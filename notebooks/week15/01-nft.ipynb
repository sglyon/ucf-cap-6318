    "\n",
    "- Over the past few weeks we have learned quite a bit about blockchains and cryptocurrencies\n",
    "- A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, public ledger\n",
    "    - Primary application: means of recording transfers of crypto currencies (e.g. BTC)\n",
    "- Smart contracts as we know them today started with Ethereum\n",
    "    - Use blockchain to store and execute computer programs\n",
    "    - Transactions can now include arbitrary logig... *unlimited* potential\n",
    "- Standards have been developed to allow smart contracts to interact with one another\n",
    "    - The ERC-20 standard defines what it means to be a \"token\"\n",
    "    - There are tens of thousands of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain today (Nov. 2021)\n",
    "- We learned about decentralized finance (Defi)\n",
    "    - Systems of smart contracts implement financial primitives (trading, borrowing, insurance, lending, etc.) \n",
    "    - These systems operate on the ERC-20 standard, making them composable and flexible\n",
    "    - Opportunity to define arbitrary financial systems (\"I wrote financial systems into existence\" Hamilton)\n",

    "- There is some debate about where the idea of NFTs on a blockchain originated\n",

    "    - Cryptopunks (early 2017): 10,000 unique, but randomly generated \"pixel art\" images\n",
    "    - Cryptokitties (late 2017): buy, breed, sell game that nearly brought ethereum to a halt (caused increase in gas limit)\n",
    "    - Creation of many NFT platforms (2018-present): [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), [SuperRare](https://superrare.com), [Rarible](https://rarible.com), [Solanart](https://solanart.io)\n",
    "    - ERC-721 (January 2018): proposal for formal standard/interface for NFTs on Ethereum\n",
    "    - Beeple's NFT (early 2021): images from 5,000 days that sold for over $69 million in auction at Christie's auction house"

    "- Too much code to put here, so we'll review key concepts and then check out [OpenZeppelin docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721) on ERC-721\n",
    "- Key ideas:\n",
    "    - NFTS are *grouped* into a single smart contract and *referenced* by an integer index `tokenId`\n",
    "    - Each NFT is owned by exactly one address\n",
    "    - The address (owner) must approve any other entity to be able to handle the NFT\n",
    "    - Only one non-owner can be approved at a time\n",
    "    - If recipient of transfer doesn't know how to handle NFTs, could be lost forever... use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom`\n",
    "    - Extensions to core standard allow associating metadata (images, files, movies, etc.) with token"
