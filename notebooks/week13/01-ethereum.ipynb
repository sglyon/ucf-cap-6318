    "- Uniswap is a smart contract system that allows users to swap one ethereum based token for another one\n",
    "- We'll learn much more about it in a future lecture\n",
    "- For now we'll focus only on a specific type of event: [`Swap`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/234f27b9bc745eee37491802aa37a0202649e344/contracts/interfaces/pool/IUniswapV3PoolEvents.sol#L64-L80)\n",
    "- The `Swap` event is emitted every time a trade or swap happens on the platform\n",
    "- The Uniswap team uses it to track things like:\n",
    "    - Total number of swaps\n",
    "    - Swaps per user\n",
    "    - Swaps per coin\n",
    "    - Price of coins\n",
    "    - Volume in USD of swaps\n",
    "    - Etc.\n",
    "- We can see all this processed log data on their data dashboard: https://info.uniswap.org/#/"
